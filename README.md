Smart Garden Bed Planter for Intelligent Plant Care, IOT project

**Smart Garden Bed Planter with Integrated IoT Sensors**

 Project Overview

Smart Garden Bed Planter is an IoT-based intelligent plant monitoring system designed to automate and optimize plant care. The system continuously monitors key environmental parameters such as soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and light intensity, and uses that data to make real-time decisions — such as activating irrigation when the soil gets dry.

This project aims to help users maintain healthy plants with minimal effort by integrating sensor networks, microcontrollers, and cloud-based monitoring dashboards.


### Features

 Temperature & Humidity Monitoring – Tracks environmental conditions using DHT11/DHT22 sensors.

 Soil Moisture Detection – Measures real-time soil moisture levels to prevent overwatering or dehydration.

 Light Intensity Measurement – Uses LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) to analyze sunlight exposure.

 Automatic Irrigation Control – Activates a water pump automatically when soil is too dry.

 IoT Connectivity – Sends live data to cloud platforms (like ThingSpeak, Blynk, or MQTT dashboard) for real-time monitoring.

 Data Visualization Dashboard – Displays trends and sensor readings via a web or mobile interface.

 Smart Alerts – Sends notifications to users when parameters go beyond defined thresholds.


### Tech Stack

Hardware: Arduino UNO / NodeMCU (ESP8266 or ESP32), DHT11/DHT22, Soil Moisture Sensor, LDR, Relay Module, Mini Water Pump

Software: Arduino IDE / PlatformIO

Cloud Platforms: Blynk / ThingSpeak / MQTT / Firebase (optional)

Programming Languages: C / C++ (Embedded C for microcontrollers)

Communication Protocols: Wi-Fi, MQTT


### System Architecture

-Sensors collect environmental data (temperature, humidity, light, soil moisture).

-Microcontroller processes data and sends it to the cloud via Wi-Fi.

-Cloud dashboard visualizes data in real time.

-Based on sensor readings, the microcontroller automatically controls the water pump.

-Users can manually control the system through a mobile app or web dashboard.


### Future Enhancements

 AI-based plant health prediction using data analytics.

 Mobile app integration for control and notifications.

 Solar-powered automation for energy efficiency.

 Support for multiple plants/zones with smart irrigation scheduling.


### Project Goals

Promote smart agriculture and urban gardening using IoT.

Reduce manual plant maintenance efforts.

Enable data-driven insights for better plant health management.
